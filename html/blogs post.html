    <h1>Beautiful Places in India</h1>
    <h2 class="h2">taj mahal</h2>
    <p>The Taj Mahal is one of the most famous monuments in the world and is counted among the Seven Wonders of the World. It is located in Agra, India, on the banks of the river Yamuna. The Mughal emperor Shah Jahan built it in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, which is why it is known as a symbol of love. The monument is made of pure white marble, and its beauty shines even more in the moonlight. Every year, thousands of tourists from around the world visit the Taj Mahal to admire its stunning architecture and historical importance. It truly represents India’s rich culture and heritage.</p>
